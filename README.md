# Escape Button Project

## Overview
The Escape Button project is an engaging and interactive web page where a button amusingly avoids being clicked by moving to random positions on the screen. This project is hosted on GitHub Pages and demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create dynamic and responsive user interactions.

## Features
- **Dynamic Movement**: The "Click Me to View My Work" button moves to a random position on the screen when the user attempts to hover over it.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Uses CSS transitions to smoothly animate the button's movement.
- **Interactive Message**: Displays a message thanking the user when they manage to click the button.
- **Stop Button**: Includes a "Stop Movement" button that allows users to stop the button's movement after 30 seconds.

## How to Use
1. **Visit the Project Page**: Navigate to the GitHub Pages URL where the project is hosted.
2. **Interact with the Button**: Try to click on the "Click Me to View My Work" button and watch as it escapes the cursor.
3. **Stop the Movement**: After 30 seconds, a "Stop Movement" button will appear. Click it to stop the button from moving.
4. **Click the Button**: Once the button is stopped, you can click it to see a thank you message.

## Technologies Used
